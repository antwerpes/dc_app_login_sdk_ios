The DocCheck App Login SDK provides you with a simple to use integration of the authentication through DocCheck. This is done by providing a ViewController which wraps the Web flow and handles callbacks for the authentication.

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 12+
- Swift 5.0+

### DocCheck Login ID
In order to ensure smooth integration and functioning always adhere to using the respective framework. Before you can implement the DocCheck Login in your app, you will need to set up a new login in CReaM (http://crm.doccheck.com/com/). For detailed instructions please read the technical manual in the download section ofÂ https://more.doccheck.com/en/industry/ (chapter 2.2.3). When a new login has been created, please add the bundle identifier (for iOS) or the package name (for Android) in the destination URL. This process in general runs as follows: topleveldomain.companyname.appname 

Example for input in the target URL in CReaM: 
```shell
doccheck://login?appid=bundleidentifier
```
### DocCheck License
For mobile applications a mobile license is required.To get more details about the different packages (basic, economy and business) as well as booking process please contact app.industry@doccheck.com. 

## Installation

### CocoaPods

DocCheckAppLogin is available through the [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) dependency management tools. To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'DocCheckAppLoginSDK'
```

For the case that the SDK is not yet listed on cocoapods you can always fall back to getting a version directly from this repository like this:

```ruby
pod 'DocCheckAppLoginSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/antwerpes/dc_app_login_sdk_ios.git', :tag => '0.1.3'
```

### Swift Package Manager - experimental

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. It is in early development, but we support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding DocCheckAppLogin as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/antwerpes/dc_app_login_sdk_ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

## Usage

```swift
let docCheckAppLogin = DocCheckAppLogin.open(
    loginId: "YOUR_LOGIN_ID",
    language: "YOUR_SELECTED_LANGUAGE", // optional will default to de
    templateName: "TEMPLATE_NAME" // optional will default to s_mobile
)
// optional listener
docCheckAppLogin.loginSuccesful = {
    // do something on success like dismissing the viewcontroller
}
docCheckAppLogin.loginFailed = { error in
    // do something on failed login like showing an error message
}
docCheckAppLogin.loginCanceled = {
    // do something on user initiated cancel like showing a hint
}
docCheckAppLogin.receivedUserInformations = { userInfo in
    // get user information based on what was provided by the server
}
```

## Example

An example project with integration instructions can be found in the [Example Repository](https://github.com/antwerpes/dc_app_login_sdk_ios_example)

Please note that additional parameters can be delivered in case of valid consent for data transfer in combination with an implemented business license. For more Details, please check the OAuth2 documentation. Thats one can be reuqested via app.industry@doccheck.com. 


## Parameter Routing 
Starting with the economy license, a routing by parameter, language or country can be configured. Routing parameters must be configured within CReaM via the login configuration (step 4 "Specials" > configure profession/languag/country routing) 
Within CReaM a individual value can be definied for a certain profession. Those values will be passed via the login framework towards your mobile application.

The parameter can be defined as follows: 
```
&profession=physician
```
```
&country=germany
```

Watchouts: 
- parameter must be configured "paramater=value", otherwise it won't be parsed as an parameter in the response
- Don't forget to implement a fallback if no parameter is added via CReaM
